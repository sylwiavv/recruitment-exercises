    content:
      "The series takes its cue from an appendix Tolkien wrote for the final instalment of his epic, slenderly outlining the history of Middle-earth's Second Age. By necessity – legal as well as creative (Amazon doesn't own the rights to posthumously published materials in which Tolkien goes into greater depth on the Second Age) – the show's writers have had to alter and embellish, compressing time frames, inventing new characters and tinkering with the storylines of some canonical creations.",

    title: 'Is the final Hobbit film a flop?',
    content:
      'The Battle of the Five Armies is undoubtedly a colossal technical achievement, with something marvellous to look at in every corner of the screen. The CGI is immeasurably better than it was in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and no dragon in cinema history has ever been as awe-inspiring as the vast, snaking, spiny Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). And it’s not just the monsters that are spectacular. Just as much care and attention has gone into the tiniest details of the characters’ armour, weaponry and hairstyles. There aren’t many film productions which would go to the effort of engraving the toggles on either end of a dwarf’s moustache.',

      'Five companies told him they had to delay hiring because of Covid-19 – but only after he’d done the final round of interviews. Another three invited him for several rounds of interviews until it was time to make an offer, at which point they decided to promote internally. Then, he made it through three rounds of interviews for a director-level position at a company he really liked, only to receive an email to co-ordinate six more rounds.',
